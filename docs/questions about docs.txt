Unique users:
-How do I make this count? I see there's a root users property (root/users), which has about 1100 users, but inside each school (root/schools/id/users) I can see there's more than 1100 (i.e. duke has 1237 users)

% of school population:
-(How many users in the school) / (Unique Users) * 100

Active users (real time)
-Could not find this information in firebase

Sessions over time chart:
-Could not find sessions history in firebase
-With date selection, the year filter would not apply. Because if you select a specific date, there's only one year to show (the same for 'Users over time' chart, 'event posting over time' chart and 'people attendance over time' chart)

Total number of sessions/Avg. session duration:
-Could not find sessions history in firebase


PAGE 2

Grad/undergrad chart
-How many users with academic_level as grad or ungrad
-Analysing the data, if it was possible to have the user's school_id on root/users/user_id, would be easier to make this math when this chart represents all the users of all schools


Years at duke
-How do I get this info? I have the graduation year information. If I have each major's duration, I can do the math, otherwise I would have to use a chart representing how many years left to finish or representing the graduation year itself

Fields of study
-Group and count users majors. Will have to check for duplicates

Self-reported interests
-Group andd count declared interests by users (is it a free text input? If so, I will have to check for duplicates as I'm expected to do with majors)


PAGE 3

Event length
-Time between event's start_time and end_time

Event planning time
-Time between event's post_time and start_time

Events by interest
-Group and count activities by it's 'interests' field

Events charts
-'event posting over time' will show the number of events over time respecting date selection
-'people attendance over time' will show how many people attended to events over time, respecting date selection, considering the date of the attended event
-I missed the difference between the 'event time' and 'event posting over time' selection on this chart

Events by audience
-This will be pretty much the same as the Page 2 charts with interests filtering (when clicking in 'Events by interest' chart items)


PAGE 4

Active groups
-Count existing groups.
-Is this a count of all system groups, or only selected school groups?

Avg. hosted events by groups
-(Numver of hosted events) / (Number active groups)

Avg. group size
-(Numbr of users who belongs to groups) / (Number active groups)

About parsing duplicated majors:

I found that if I split all majors looking for those separators: ',','/' and 'and', trim it, and then use it's lower case format, I can remove most of the duplicates. The exception is when some inputs, for example, 'statz' instead of 'statistics'. To solve this, we can have some pre-defined 'labels' to replace this kind of misstyping, so when I find 'statz', I consider it 'statistics'


About parsing duplicated hometowns:
I did not see any duplicate problems on this case. I think just trim it and use it's lower case format will work fine.

About the specification doc:
-When you say you want to be able to sort by flagged posts, you mean a post with at least one flag, or a post which has more flags than allowed on MAXFLAGS?
